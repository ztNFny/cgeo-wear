Revival of the old [c:geo Wear](https://github.com/cjmoran/cgeo-wear) project.

I'm currently developing this for my own use on a Fossil Sports Wear OS watch. The app is currently based on the old code but I plan a full rewrite. There won't be any official release before this rewrite arrives.

If you're interested in joining forces please ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PHtQuE). Looking for someone with experience with Android development!

Please don't contact me with support requests or stuff, this project is not prime-time ready!

Usage:
- Install on phone + watch
- In c:geo navigate -> Radar, select c:geo Wear (and "Always")

Todo:
- change package name
- full rewrite
- support QC 3100 ambient mode (http://turndapage.com/2018/12/07/implementing-the-new-ambient-second-hand-for-wear-os-with-watch-face-decompositions/)
